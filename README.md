## 🐶Overview

This is a solution to the [WiseGoat challenge by Lorena - DevChallenge](https://github.com/devchallenge-io/wisegoat).

### The challenge
- Consume the data from two API's and create a website that generates advice and images.
- Extra: apply an animation to the animal on the homepage, to give the effect that it is floating.

As a personal challenge, I decided to add an extra button where the user can click to receive other advice and also make the website responsive.
