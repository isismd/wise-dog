## 🐶Overview

This is a solution to the [WiseGoat challenge by Lorena - DevChallenge](https://github.com/devchallenge-io/wisegoat).

### The challenge
Consume the data from two API's and create a website that generates advice and images.
Extra: apply an animation to the animal on the homepage, to give the effect that it is floating.

🎯 As a personal challenge, I decided to:
 - add an extra button where the user can click to receive other advice. 
 - make the website responsive.
